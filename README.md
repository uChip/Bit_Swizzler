# Bit Swizzler

A small Arduino sketch to shuffle the bit order in a 7-segment display character generator to match the pin assignments on a PCB.  The #define statements at the top of the sketch specify what bit order you want.  The program then prints out compiler ready code.  Just copy/paste the code from the Arduino runtime window into your sketch.
